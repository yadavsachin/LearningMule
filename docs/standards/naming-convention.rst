Naming Convention
==================

MuleSoft doesn't provide any specific naming conventions for mule projects, but it's always important to follow standards and guideline while working on any project. So here based on my experience, I'm putting guidelines that can be followed in Mule Application.

The goal of these guidelines is to create uniform coding standards among developers so that reading, checking and maintaining code written by different developers becomes easier. Naming convention and standards mentioned in this document is to ensure the code is clean and consistent and developers are able to maintain efficient productivity.


Application Name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the first thing which needs to do is create a new project or application and one of the tricky parts is naming the project.

Following points need to be considered while naming application name

- A name should be meaningful and reflect the purpose/usage of the application.
- The name should be in a small case.
- If application name has multiple words then it should be separated by a hyphen (-).
- For better naming convention, it is preferable that application name should be prefixed by application code.
